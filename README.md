<h1>Augmented Reality For Education</h1>

Hello!
This project is an augmented reality(AR) app that is designed for the purpose of education. 

The goal of this project is to To determine the effectiveness of learning <br>through Augmented Reality when compared to traditional learning methods.


There are two applications.
<p>
The first is an application that allows an individual to curate a learning experience by
<br>
providing images that when tracked by the app will display additional information about
<br>
the image or provide 3d effects.
<br>
Here are some examples:

<br>
Ideally, multiple different trackable images will be printed out on a large poster board.
</p>
<p>
The second application is currently in development and is in the development branch.
